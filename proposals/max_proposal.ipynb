    "# How does the frequency of family visits predict subjective happiness and self-rated physical health?\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency of family visits (`CONNECTION_activities_visited_family_p3m`). A box plot for frequency of family visits allows you to see the distribution of visit frequencies and identify any potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subjective happiness (`WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Self-rated physical health (`WELLNESS_self_rated_physical_health`).\n",
    "A scatter plot for both variables here against the frequency of family visits would show the individual data points clearly, and allow you to identify trends as well as fitting a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance of Variables**: The frequency of family visits is important as it could be correlated with subjective happiness and positively influence individualsâ€™ self-rated physical health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct linear regression analyses to evaluate how well the frequency of family visits predicts both subjective happiness and self-rated physical health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subjective Happiness = $\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\cdot \\text{Family Visits} + \\epsilon_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical Health = $\\beta_{0}' + \\beta_{1}' \\cdot \\text{Family Visits} + \\epsilon_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): The frequency of family visits has no effect on subjective happiness or self-rated physical health $(\\beta_1, \\beta_1 = 0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_1$): The frequency of family visits positively influences subjective happiness and self-rated physical health $(\\beta_1, \\beta_1' \\ne 0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical values will be assigned to the ordinal data, to which a line will be fitted and used to generate a summary. If the regression coefficients for family visits are statistically significant, it would indicate that more frequent family visits are associated with higher levels of subjective happiness and better self-rated physical health. This analysis would help establish the predictive relationship between family interaction and well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that there is a linear relationship, the observations are independent, homoscedasticity, as well as residual normality. If the data isn't normally distributed, transformations (such as `log`) can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: We hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between the frequency of family visits and both subjective happiness and self-rated physical health. Specifically, as the frequency of family visits increases, we expect individuals to have higher levels of happiness and better self-assessments of their physical health. By examining data on family visit frequency, we can determine if there is a statistical relationship with reported happiness and health levels."

This method enables us to analyze how different levels of burnout symptoms influence the likelihood of preferring various types of social activities.
