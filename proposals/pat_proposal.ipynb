    "### Q1: How does the frequency of social interaction with family, friends, and neighbors relate to feelings of existential loneliness and emotional well-being among survey respondents?\n",
    "\n",
    "This questions explores how the frequency of social interaction with family, friends, and neighbors relates to existential loneliness and emotional well-being. The goal is to determine if more frequent social interactions are linked to lower loneliness and higher well-being scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Social Interaction Frequency**  \n",
    "   - **Variables:** `CONNECTION_social_days_family_p7d`, `CONNECTION_social_days_friends_p7d`, `CONNECTION_social_days_neighbours_p7d`\n",
    "   - **Response Categories:** none, some (1-3), most (4-6), every day\n",
    "   - **Visualization:** Bar charts will display the distribution of responses across different interaction frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loneliness Metrics**  \n",
    "   - **Variables:** `LONELY_existential_loneliness_scale_outlook`, `LONELY_existential_loneliness_scale_share`\n",
    "   - **Response Scale:** 1-9 (1 = strongly agree, 9 = strongly disagree) \n",
    "   - **Visualization:** Box plots will illustrate loneliness scores grouped by interaction frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Emotional Well-Being**  \n",
    "   - **Variable:** `LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_emptiness`\n",
    "   - **Response Categories:** yes, no, more or less \n",
    "   - **Visualization:** Stacked bar charts will compare well-being states across interaction levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Plan:**\n",
    "1. Calculate descriptive statistics for each variable to summarize mean and standard deviation for loneliness and well-being scores at each interaction frequency level.\n",
    "2. Use bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals for mean loneliness and emotional well-being scores. Non-overlapping confidence intervals will suggest significant differences across interaction levels.\n",
    "3. Set up linear regression models with loneliness and emotional well-being as outcomes to assess the impact of social interaction frequency on these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions** \n",
    "-  loneliness scale has a linear relationship with the frequency of social interactions.\n",
    "- Bootstrapping assumes that our sample is representative of the population and is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses:**\n",
    "- **Existential Loneliness:** H<sub>0</sub>: No association between social interaction frequency and loneliness scores. We expect a negative association; more frequent interactions should correlate with lower loneliness.\n",
    "- **Emotional Well-Being:** H<sub>0</sub>: No association between social interaction frequency and well-being scores. We anticipate a positive association; more social interactions should relate to higher well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Results:**\n",
    "- **Bootstrapping:** Expect narrower, lower confidence intervals for loneliness scores at higher interaction frequencies, with significant differences indicated by non-overlapping intervals.\n",
    "- **Linear Regression:** Anticipate negative coefficients for loneliness scores and positive coefficients for emotional well-being at higher interaction levels compared to the \"rarely\" baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance:** If confirmed, these findings suggest that increased social interaction may protect against loneliness and enhance emotional well-being, informing mental health interventions and public health initiatives aimed at reducing social isolation."
